# wedding-invitation
It's a cool website to inform about details of the wedding. Every picture, and background design was stored in an own folder, and linked from it. So the have a relative access path. This website adjusts to all platform, to all size of screens. You can watch it on your phone, and on your monitor too, because of built-in mediaquery breakpoints.

# Built with:
Html5,
CSS,
Mediaquery (within CSS),

I built it in JSBin, test the live page in it, and after that, I built in my desktop editor, brackets.
I got the font-family from google fonts.
